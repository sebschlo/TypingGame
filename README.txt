The sentence generator was adapted from the code in this link:
http://udel.edu/~caviness/Classb/CISC367-99S/example-progs/randomSentences/RandomSent.java

I also based a lot of my code on the Ray Wenderlich tutorials mentioned in the
Android file in Canvas.

COOL THINGS:

- score data persists through shared preferences
- you can switch users by tapping on the settings menu on the top action bar
-
